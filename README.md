# Open Budget: Grand Rapids, MI



## Development

We are developing a way to better understand the budget process for the City of Grand Rapids. This will be the follow-up to the initial release of [openbudgetgr.org](http://openbudgetgr.org).

Our project is based off the work done by Code for America Brigades in [Oakland](http://openbudgetoakland.org/) and [Sacramento](http://openbudgetsac.org/).
